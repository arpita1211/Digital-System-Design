# Digital-System-Design-Lab
Designed and implemented various combinational and sequential digital circuits in Verilog, including adders, subtractors, comparators, shift registers, counters, frequency dividers, and finite state machines (FSMs). Simulated and verified circuit behavior using testbenches and waveform analysis.
